Picture yourself living in a town outside of Pyongyang, North Korea, where the oppressive government regulates every aspect of your life. They deny you access to the Internet or television, and education is focused solely on political indoctrination rather than academic learning. Your family shares a cramped apartment that relies on government-provided rations for survival. Day after day, you wake up to the same dreary reality, but still refuse to give up hope. You yearn for a brighter future, one where freedom and opportunity exist beyond the borders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Laying down in bed at night, your mind races with ideas of escape, wondering how to break free from this suffocating grip of the North Korean regime. Despite the risks, you know you must do whatever it takes to achieve the dream of a better life.

Desperation sets in when considering your options. It's common knowledge that any attempt to break free from the regime will be incredibly dangerous and can result in severe consequences for not only you but also your family. First, assess the risks and determine the safest and most feasible way to leave the country. You scour the neighbourhood, looking for any opportunity to gather information or resources that could help. Snippets of conversation float through the air while you walk through the streets, trying to pick up on any leads that could help. Talk of smugglers, black-market traders, and people who have made it to China or other neighbouring countries are gathered as intel. But everyone seems to also be scared and reluctant to speak of anything that potentially gets them in trouble.

Now, notice the way people look over their shoulders, the hushed whispers and subtle hand gestures exchanged between strangers. Your heart races with excitement and fear as you realize that you're not alone with a desire to break free.

You become bolder with attempts to make contact, approaching people who look like they might be sympathetic to your plight. Some are dismissive or outright hostile, warning to stay away from such dangerous ideas. But others offer slight gestures of support, passing along scraps of information or offering a word of encouragement.

They have a certain look in their eyes, a sense of caution that suggests they might have connections outside of North Korea. You approach these individuals, carefully testing the waters to see if they are trustworthy. After several weeks of attending these events, you finally meet someone who appears to be willing to assist you. He looks around, making sure no one is watching, and then introduces themselves as a smuggler, claiming to have helped dozens of people escape the country over the years. Still whispering, he says to meet him in a small clearing in the woods on the outskirts of town at midnight, with a large sum of payment.

The night of the attempted escape finally arrives, and you tiptoe out of the apartment, heart pounding. With every step, it feels like you're being watched and listened to, paranoia gripping tightly. When you arrive at the rendezvous point, you scan the area nervously, searching for any signs of danger. And then, like a shadow emerging from the darkness, the trafficker emerges. He beckons you to follow him through the woods, his footsteps barely audible against the underbrush. Your legs are heavy with exhaustion and anxiety, and the every snap of a twig or rustle of a leaf makes you jump. As you near the border, the smuggler hands over the small black raft, his eyes darting around nervously, and whispers "Row across the river, don't stop."

You paddle vigorously across the murky water, your mind racing with a mix of emotions. You feel both a sense of excitement for the new possibilities that await you in China and a deep sense of fear of being caught. The sound of your paddle striking the water reverberates in the still night, amplifying your anxiety. The river is wide and unpredictable, the small raft struggling to stay on course amidst the swirling currents. It's as if the darkness is weighing you down, smothering your senses. As the bank draws closer, you can discern the faint outline of a village in the distance, a glimmer of light in the surrounding blackness approaching. The shore comes into view and the town looms closer. Your heart pounds in your chest, and your hands tremble with adrenaline as you clamber onto the muddy bank, finally reaching your destination. The journey was long and treacherous, but the sense of relief and accomplishment is overwhelming. You take a moment and catch your breath. You are no longer bound by the strict confines of the North Korean regime, no longer subjected to a life of political indoctrination and poverty. You are free.
